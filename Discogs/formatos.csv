26,Alexi Delano,artist,Not For Release Traxx 1,"alexi delano ‘s music production dwells in perfect balance between shiny minimalism and dark vivacious techno. with more than two decades on stage he has been able to combine different roots and facets of the contemporary music scene.
born in chile, raised in sweden and later on adopted by new york city, alexi was part of the swedish wave of electronic music producers of the mid 90’s such as adam beyer, cari lekebusch, jesper dahlback and joel mull. moving from scandinavia to new york influenced him to combine the heavy compressed swedish sound with the vibrancy of the creative music scene of brooklyn.

throughout his music career, alexi has been nominated for the swedish music award ‘p3 guld’ (an alternative to the swedish grammy), produced six albums and released countless records on established labels such as the iconic swedish label svek, plus 8, minus, hybrid, drumcode, visionquest, spectral sound, get physical, poker flat and many more. 
with a music production and dj style swinging between house and techno, he is consistently reinventing himself with each new release.",1995,"12""",137274,https://www.discogs.com/artist/26-Alexi-Delano,https://api.discogs.com/artists/26/releases,Vinyl,"house, electronic, techno"

born: 1972. 

based in stockholm, sweden. performing vinyl dj sets, creating audio/music productions, and graphic works. collected music from the late 1970s, thru hip hop, electro, house, techno, and other similar styles. 

the early 1980s where filled with breakdancing and spray-painting everything that was possible around the stockholm areas. 

early musical influences came from usa & germany. ""remember grandmaster flash, dj red alert, african bambaata and the soul sonic force, bdp, busy b, soundmasters, egyptian lover, and how about ice-t in ""reckless"" by chris the glove taylor (including one of the first great tr-808 and tb-303 programmings ever). that was some amazing stuff back then, and i will never forget when kraftwerk released man machine and computer world. then we have mantronix, ultramagnetic mc's, whoodini, them where great times!"". 

all this got cari to start collecting equipment for his own recording studio. international and national releases have been made on: drumcode and truesoul records, code red, corb, proper nyc, harthouse, ffrr, jakpot, loop and plumphouse records, missile, jericho, influence, tortured, and electrix records uk, primevil, svek, planet rhythm, tronic music, experimental nyc, ohm records / telegram, analog usa. own label projects include: djupt, grundtakt, trainspotters nightmare, audiomekanixc, audio pollution, kgb, direkt, kaun trax, spirit fuel, together with hybrid productions as the main platform. 

in 1998 a legal twist started between hybrid productions and awex inc owned pop group called ""hybrid"", which resulted into a name change – thus the dot after the h in h. productions.
